      <h2>2. How to delete your account</h2>
      <h3>2.1 From within the app (recommended)</h3>
      <p>
        In the BoozeUP app, you will find an in-app path to delete your account and data
        via the account or settings section. Use that option if you still have access to
        the app on your device.
      </p>

      <h3>2.2 From this page (web request)</h3>
      <p>
        If you no longer have the app installed or prefer a web request, you can submit
        an account deletion request using the button below.
      </p>

      <ol class="da-list">
        <li>Click the “Request account deletion” button.</li>
        <li>Your email app opens with a pre-filled message to MultiDelt.</li>
        <li>Confirm that the email address you send from matches the one used in BoozeUP.</li>
        <li>Review the details in the email body and send your request.</li>
      </ol>

    <!-- 3. What we delete -->
    <section class="da-section" id="what-is-deleted">
      <h2>3. What will be deleted</h2>
      <p>When we process an account deletion request, we aim to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>delete your BoozeUP account and login credentials from our systems;</li>
        <li>delete or anonymize your profile information (nickname, profile picture);</li>
        <li>delete or anonymize your gameplay, group membership and statistics linked to your account ID;</li>
        <li>stop sending you notifications or in-app messages related to that account.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We may retain a minimal amount of information for a limited time where required by law
        or for legitimate purposes such as fraud prevention, security or dispute resolution.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Timeframe & verification -->
    <section class="da-section" id="timeframe">
      <h2>4. Verification and timeframe</h2>
      <p>
        For your security, we may need to verify that you are the owner of the account before
        completing the deletion. This usually means confirming that you control the email
        address used for BoozeUP.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once we have verified your request, we aim to complete account and data deletion
        within <strong>30 days</strong>, unless a different period is required by local law.
